          <h1>What Powers 8tracks?</h1>
            <h2>by Sarah Edwards</h2>
          <div id="post-content">
            <p><a href="http://8tracks.com/" target="_blank">8tracks</a> is a music radio service that has placed an emphasis on user-created playlists, rather than those generated by an algorithm. <a href="http://8tracks.com/about" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> This has given a community of music lovers a platform to share playlists with one another and discover new artists.</p>
            <p>So, what powers 8tracks?</p>
            <p>Peter Bui, an infrastructure engineer at 8tracks, says that their stack is built on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> and that they use <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> as their database. "We manage all our servers with <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/" target="_blank">Chef</a>," he explains.  The web servers themselves operate via <a href="http://nginx.org/" target="_blank">nginx</a>. They also utilize a number of <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> servers, though Bui doesn't go into detail. <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technical-architecture-of-8tracks" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> 8tracks is primarily programmed using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, but <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> is used out of convenience in instances where less complexity is necessary. <a href="http://8tracks.com/technology" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a> When using 8tracks, users can search for up to three tags at once, in order to tailor their playlists to their current mood. For example, a user might search for, "indie rock," "happy," and "summer," to receive a list of results that fit each of the criteria. Any searches done by the user are handled by <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Solr</a>. <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technical-architecture-of-8tracks" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
            <p>8tracks uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> to improve load time for users, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">BackboneJS</a> as the basic framework for their web app. <a href="http://8tracks.com/technology" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a> As 8tracks does allow users to stream audio, it's unsurprising that all of their audio files are encoded in the stream-friendly AAC format. <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-quality-are-the-audio-files-on-8tracks-encoded-in" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a> The playback of all audio files is handled by <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/" target="_blank">Soundmanager 2</a>, web software that supports "a truly ridiculous range of browsing platforms," effectively eliminating any incompatibility issues across browsers. <a href="http://8tracks.com/technology" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
            <p>A partnership with <a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> allows users to search the library of tracks available through the Soundcloud service, rather than spending the time to upload their own tracks in order to create a playlist. Another partnership with <a href="http://www.imgix.com/" target="_blank">imgix</a> gives 8tracks a place to host images uploaded for playlist covers, and allows those images to be responsive across different devices. <a href="http://8tracks.com/technology" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
            <p>It seems 8tracks is becoming increasingly committed to being "the source" for music discovery. In an effort to help users learn more about the artists they are listening to, 8tracks has decided to use an API called <a href="http://openaura.com/" target="_blank">OpenAura</a> that is filled with various artist biographies. <a href="http://blog.8tracks.com/2014/03/26/8tracks-%E2%9D%A4s-openaura/" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a> These biographies appear whenever a user is listening to a playlist. OpenAura actually allows artists to claim their "aura" and modify any of the information in order to promote accuracy. <a href="http://openaura.com/faq#artists" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
            <p>8tracks has used all of these things to create a web app that is undoubtedly one of the best available for music lovers. It will be interesting to see how 8tracks continues to adapt future technology and see if its user base continues to expand.</p>
